Advent of Code 2020

Contains puzzle inputs (full and test) and my solutions for Days 7+ from the December 2020 Advent of Code challenge (https://adventofcode.com/2020).

Days 1-6 were written in December 2020, when I was still very new to coding. I had taken a couple of free online courses, most recently Harvard's CS-50 on edX. I used their IDE because I had no idea how to set up my own or even choose another one. I used Python because it seemed easier than C or Javascript, the other two languages I had enough experience with to write more than "Hello, world."

Eventually I hit a wall with Day 7. I had a hunch that I needed to use dictionaries, but I was still shaky on how they worked and didn't understand nested data structures. I was also shaky when it came to parsing strings and slicing lists. I set it aside.

As of this writing (August 8, 2021), I'm three weeks into a Data Science bootcamp with the Flatiron School--still very new to coding, but better at googling and reading documentation. So far in the program we've done a lot with Python and nested data structures. Earlier today I noticed AOC Day 7 still open in a very old tab...and suddenly and simultaneously remembered the nature of the puzzle and had an idea for a solution. It feels good to be tackling these again, this time with a little more context and a little more know-how.
